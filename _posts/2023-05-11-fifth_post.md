## Consulting Previous Research to Inform my own Solutions

Since Q3 of the assignment requires me to investigate different techniques and theory on creating deep learning models to classify AI generated (fake) images, I searched on Google Scholar for recent and relevant academic papers from reputable sources.

The following are pdfs of these papers:
- [**Academic Book for Detection of AI-Generated Synthetic Faces**](/pdfs/Academic-Book-for-Detection-of-AI-Generated-Synthetic-Faces-See-Pg-193-or-Chp-9-2022.pdf)
- [**An Explainable DeepFake Detection Framework on a Novel Unconstrained Dataset**](/pdfs/An-explainable-deepfake-detection-framework-on-a-novel-unconstrained-dataset-2023.pdf)
- [**An Improvised CNN Model for Fake Image Detection**](/pdfs/An-improvised-CNN-model-for-fake-image-detection-2022.pdf)
- [**CIFAKE Image Classification and Explainable Identification of AI Generated Synthetic Images**](/pdfs/CIFAKE-Image-Classification-and-Explainable-Identification-of-AI-Generated-Synthetic-Images-2023.pdf)
- [**DeepFake Detection for Human Face Images and Videos A Survey**](/pdfs/DeepFake_Detection_for_Human_Face_Images_and_Videos_A_Survey-2022.pdf)
- [**DeepFakes Generation and Detection State of the Art**](/pdfs/Deepfakes-generation-and-detection-state-of-the-art-2022.pdf)
- [**GAN Generated Faces Detection**](/pdfs/GAN-generated-Faces-Detection-2023.pdf)

None of these papers use fastai to create their models, however, they all cover the topic of classifying AI generated images in technical depth as well as provide their own methodologies. Hopefully these papers will introduce me to new ideas as well as further deepen my understanding of deep learning.
