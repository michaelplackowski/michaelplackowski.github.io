# About

The purpose of this blog is to document my progress as well as what I have learned about AI using the fastai course created by Jeremy Howard.

The creation of this blog is as per Question 1 on Assignment 3 of The University of Queensland's course, ELEC4630 - Image Processing & Computer Vision.
